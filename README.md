# Example Android Application for real time tracker 

Example of android app with live tracking of a user's location using Google Maps v2 and the Google Play Services geo location api.

A Service in second plan is used to receive the updates of the position and to save it in a static variable that will have the duration of the process that has the application.

## Usage
In order to compile and use this code it is necessary to include a Google Map ApiKey in the Strings resource file of the application. This Api Key can be obtained through the Google Developer Console.

## ToDo
- Add a database to save routes
- Create new option for pause traking
- Show a list/detail of saved routes

Any feedback is welcome :)
